// modelChain tracks, for the lifetime of one Run, which model in a
// configured fallback list is currently serving a role. It exists because
// the retry middleware only ever retries the same model: a provider that
// answers 429 (rate limit or quota exhausted) keeps answering 429 on every
// retry, so without something to hand the next attempt to a different
// provider, a quota outage on the primary is a dead turn even when a
// perfectly usable fallback is configured.
//
// A chain is scoped to a single Run call, not shared across turns: quota
// limits are frequently transient (a burst limit, not an outage), so each
// new turn is worth one attempt against the primary before falling back
// again.

// at startIndex -- 0 for the primary, or a sticky fallback's remembered
// index when its cooldown has not yet expired. An out-of-range startIndex
